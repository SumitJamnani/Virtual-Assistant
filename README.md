# Virtual Assistant Using Python

using python libraries i developed virtual assistant. which will help you to do works with just voice command instead of manually. you just give input in voice command and assistant will show you your desirable output. it will search info from local script, which is used regularly and frequently and if information is not available in local script then it will provide results from wikipedia,google,and many search engines.. for more about this project check it on my github :)
